# APDL Self-Sufficient Simulation Script

This repository contains an APDL script used in my Master's thesis to automate simulation setup, boundary condition application, and stress result extraction in ANSYS Mechanical APDL.

## How to Use

1. Open ANSYS Mechanical APDL.
2. Run `Random displacement.txt` as a batch input script.
3. Geometry should be located at:  
   `E:\Master thesis 2 (Automation)\Ansys\original file.igs` or change the directory as you prefere in the codes and name the geometry "original file.igs"
4. Output: `stress_results_00.txt` contains von Mises stress values for nodes 35â€“110.
